I am a father, an engineer, and always curious about new technologies.
After graduating from university, I worked as a software engineer for about 10 years, with experience in hardware testing, DevOps, and software development. During the period, I also continued to look for the areas I wanted to go deep into. In mid-2021, I plan to become a cloud practitioner. Therefore, I will record all the knowledge I have learned or certificate preparation here. Happy learning and coding!
